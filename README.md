# grid-optimizer &mdash; Complex optimization on 2-dimensional grids

grid-optimizer makes use of the [Simulated Annealing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) algorithm to optimize and arange grid connections from a state of complete chaos to an optimal state.

## Installation

grid-optimizer is written in Python, tested against 2.7 and uses the following modules:
	- [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/) for graphics to represent grid connections
	- [pyplot](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) for analysis of parameters

This is an iterative algorithm, and each cycle will transition the grid to a new state which can be viewed using the `pygame` interface.

The verbosity can be specified and has the following levels:
	- 0 will only print lines on `stdout` for each iteration.
	- 1 will display the state of the grid at the beginning and end of the algorithm.
	- 2 will display the state of the grid for every iteration - not recommended.

There are 2 important parameters that can be specified:
	- Tau is the initial perturbation coefficient - representing in the analogy to simulated annealing how high the temperature us. It's a probability so has to be between 0 and 1, and the bigger the value, the hotter the temperature.
	- Beta is the cooling factor, meaning after every iteration this will determine how much we decrease the temperature. A higher number will decrease the temperature more slowly.

For a complete list of all parameters available, you can use the help menu:

    $ ./simulated_annealing -h
    Usage: simulated_annealing [options]

	Options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -s SIZE, --size=SIZE  size of the grid in format WxH
	  -t TAU, --tau=TAU     initial perturbation coefficient
	  -b BETA, --beta=BETA  cooling factor
	  -v VERBOSE, --verbose=VERBOSE
	                        verbose level
	  -n, --nograph         


## Example

### Initial State

With a verbose level of 1 or more, the initial state will be represented with `pygame`.
This shows the grid as a set of tiles, and various connections between each of the tiles created at random.

The goal is to minimize the total distance between each tile using the simulated annealing algorithm.

### Final State

Once the algorithm has converged, the grid will be in a state where the entropy in the system has been minimized with successive temperature decreases.
Here is an example of what a grid can look like after the algorithm is done:

Note that it is not guaranteed that the simulated annealing algorithm will find the global optima, as it could also be stuck in a local optima depending on the values of tau and beta chosen - more on that in the [analysis](#analysis) section.
